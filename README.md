# Bull's Eye Game for iOS

My very first iOS game build using Swift 4. It's based on this amazing tutorial
by Ray Wenderlich: [Your First iOS App](https://www.raywenderlich.com/5993-your-first-ios-app).

This game challenges the user to slide the slider as close as possible to the
given value. The closer it gets, the higher the points.
